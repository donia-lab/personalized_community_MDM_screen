REPO OVERVIEW 
------------------------

This repo contains the code for Javdan and Lopez et. al "Mapping drug 
metabolism by the human gut microbiome using personalized microbial
communities".

It is organized is two parts. The folder 'PD_code' contains all of the code relating
to the initial PD screen. The folder 'D1-20_code' contains the code for
the D1-20 screen. The data needed for all the scripts is included in the
repo, so you can regenerate the figures and analyses. The majority of the
code is written in Matlab, but there are a few Python scripts.

------------------------
PD CODE DESCRIPTION
------------------------

Each subfolder corresponds to a single type of analysis.

--drug_class_analysis-- 
The primary script is 'process_drug_classes.py' and tests for differences 
in the fraction of MDM+ drugs between natural, derivative, and 
semisynthetic drugs. 

--functional_group_analysis--
The primary script is 'analyze_functional_groups.py' and looks for 
enrichment or depletion of functional groups in MDM+ drugs. This script
calls the Openbabel command obgrep. 

--HSDH_abundance_analysis--
The primary script is 'aggregate_gene_abundances.m' and aggregates bowtie2
quantifications of the HSDH genes in different human cohorts. For the 
cohorts where multiple samples correspond to one subject, it combines
the results per subject. This script generates Figs 5F and 5G in the 
main text.

--in_vivo_stats--
The primary script is 'in_vivo_cap_metabolite_analysis.m' and performs
statistical testing on the results of the capecitabine PK study. This 
script generates Fig 7C in the paper.

--PD_16S_analysis--
This folder contains multiple figure generating scripts that all work
with the 16S rDNA data from the PD fecal sample and ex vivo cultures. 
'PD_family_level_figure.py' generates Fig 1B in the main text. 
'PD_ASV_level_figure.py' generates Fig 1C in the main text. 
'PD_family_level_all_days_figures.py' generates Fig 1 in Data S1.
'PD_rarefaction_figure.py' generates Fig 2 in Data S1.

--TPUP_KO_analysis--
The primary script is 'process_TPUP_KO.m' and performs statistical 
analysis and plotting on the TP/UP KO experiments. This generates 
Fig 5B in the main text. 

--D1-20_16S_qiime2_script--
This folder contains the shell script used to run qiime2 on the PD
data.

------------------------
D1-20 CODE DESCRIPTION
------------------------

The directory D1-20_code contains all the main plotting and analysis 
scripts for the D1-20 analysis of the paper. The untargeted metabolomics
code is found in the folder 'untargeted_metabolomics'.

--drug_and_metabolite_heatmap_figure--
This script generates Figs 4B and 4C in the main text. It performs most 
of the targeted metabolomics data processing statistical testing and
saves the results in 'drug_metabolism_analysis.mat' for use by down-stream
scripts. 

--ASV_heatmap_figure.m--
Generates the large ASV heatmap found in Fig 3C. 

--ASV_recovery_figure.m--
Generates the donor ASV recovery plot in Fig 3H.

--average_ENDS_figure.m--
Generates the plot of average media ENDS in Fig 3G. It takes a while to 
run. 

--correlate_depletion_and_production_figure.m--
This script looks at correlations between metabolite and parent drug
levels. Generates Fig 4F and 4G. Also generates supplementary figures
where only a single metabolite is considered in the analysis.

--correlate_metabolism_and_16S.m--
This scripts looks for correlations between 16S taxonomic elements and
drug and metabolite levels.

--culture_biomass_figure.m--
Generates the box plot of media biomasses in Fig 3D.

--culture_replicate_correlation_figure.m-- 
Generates the ex vivo culture replicability plot in Fig 25 of Data S1.

--cumulative_significant_donor_figure.m--
Generates the cumulative histogram found in Fig 4D.

--design_BG_media.m--
This script performs the analysis used to select a 70/30 BB/mGAM mixture
for BG. It also generates Fig 26 in Data S1.

--donor_16S_bar_plots_supp_figure.m--
This script generates family level 16S bar plots of all donor fecal 
samples and their corresponding ex vivo cultures. Generates Figs 5-24 in
Data S1. Also generates the plot of all BG replicates in Fig 4 in Data S1.

--donor_culture_shared_ASV_figure.m--
Generates the box plot of shared ASVs between donors and cultures in 
Fig 3F.

--donor_donor_shared_ASV_figure.m--
Generates the box plot of shared ASVs between donors and donors in 
Fig 3G.

--feces_family_level_supp_figure.m--
Generates family level bar plots of fecal samples from all donors in
Fig 3 of Data S1. 

--find_unique_ASVs.m--
Finds ASVs unique to the cultures and feces of different donors.

--hydro_metagenomic_library_figure.m--
Generates the round vs. hydrocortisone metabolite signal plot found in 
Fig 6C.

--identify_optimal_medium.m--
Identifies media that are on average optimal for different metrics 
across the twenty donors.

--read_depth_analysis_supp_fig.m--
Aanlyzes the relationship between observed media properties and sample
sequencing depths. Generates figures in Data S1 section G.

--theoretical_taxa_vs_metabolism_supp_figure.m--
Generate the theoretical producer abundance vs. measuremed metabolite 
figures shown in Fig 27 of Data S1.

--variable_metabolite_production_figure.m--
Generates the per-donor plots of metabolite production shown in Fig 4E.

--untargeted_metabolomics--
This directory contains all the code for the untargeted metabolomics. The
script 'aggregate_untargeted_metabolomics.m' takes the results of 
the Profinder feature extraction and find statistically significant 
metabolite-like features (features significant against all controls). We
then reran a minimal set of samples containing these features and subjected
the data to molecular ion networking on GNPS. 
'aggregate_metabolite_networking.m' takes the GNPS results and outputs 
the final untargeted metabolomics table. 

--D1-20_16S_qiime2_script--
This folder contains the shell script used to run qiime2 on the D1-20
data.
